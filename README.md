Step into a world where code becomes art and mathematics transforms into beauty. These captivating animations push the boundaries of digital creation, inviting you to explore realms where light, form, and movement dance in perfect harmony.

## Featured Animations

### Morphing Neon Blob
A luminous blob pulsates in space, its neon colors shifting across its surface while glowing particles orbit around it. This mesmerizing blend of organic movement and vibrant light creates a living digital artwork that constantly evolves before your eyes.

### Crystal Reflections
Light dances through this rotating crystal structure, casting rainbow reflections across its transparent facets. As it turns, new patterns emerge, revealing the interplay between geometry and light in a mesmerizing display of refracted brilliance.

### Wave Visualizer
Experience sound transformed into flowing waves of color. This responsive surface ripples and undulates to music, painting the auditory experience in shifting hues of blues, purples, and reds. Move your cursor across the surface to create your own patterns, blending musical visualization with tactile interaction.

### Liquid Metal Morph
Behold the otherworldly fluidity of liquid metal as it seamlessly transforms between abstract forms. Its mercury-like surface captures and distorts reflections while morphing from sphere to torus to cube with liquid grace, creating a captivating display of metallic elegance.

## No-Code Creation Process

The most remarkable aspect of this collection is that all animations were created without writing a single line of code. Using Cursor AI:

1. A text prompt describing the desired visual effect was provided
2. The AI generated complete implementations including:
   - Three.js scene setup
   - Complex GLSL shaders
   - Interactive controls
   - Post-processing effects
3. The resulting code was ready to run with minimal adjustments

This project demonstrates how AI is revolutionizing creative digital expression, making the gap between imagination and creation smaller than ever before.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the project directory in your terminal
3. Serve the project using a local web server. For example:
   - With Node.js: `npx serve` (requires Node.js installed)
   - With Python: `python -m http.server` (Python 3)
4. Open your browser and navigate to the local server address (typically http://localhost:8000)
5. Browse the animation gallery and click on any animation to view it

## Technologies Used

- Three.js for 3D rendering
